            <h2>Gift giving Experiences / Bespoke Design</h2>
            <p>Duration: 8 weeks</p>
            <p>Client: Hallmark C.E.</p>
            <p>Our challenge:  Design a (intangible) gift giving experience for people living far away from friends and family that expresses the giver’s emotional message.</p>
            <p>Deliverables: Digital Prototypes of a Card Personalisation Tool and the Digital Unwrapping App, a sample card, two design thinking journals documenting the design process and a handout for the client</p>
            <p>My role: Equally contributing in a design team of two people, doing user research and designing the digital unwrapping experience</p>

               <h3>Explore</h3>  
               <p>After a design brief, we started with mind mapping all aspects of the challenge, to get an overview and to decide on research methods we would use during the empathize phase. The methods we agreed on were all related to ethnographic research, because we wanted to get to know our users in their real-life environment, since gift giving is experienced on a very personal level. Moreover, we used the Explore Phase to familiarize ourselves with our client Hallmark.</p>
               <h3>Empathise</h3>     
               <p>In the empathize phase, we conducted the research methods we agreed on during the Explore Phase: ethnographic interviewing, observations, social network mapping (to get an insight into potential gift givers), scenario testing (we asked our users to sort 20 example gifts in order of their preference while thinking aloud), and an intervention (making a Dutch “Sinterklaas surprise” for our users and observe their reaction and behavioral patterns).</p>

             <div class="LeftText">
               <h3>Define</h3>
               <p>In the Define Phase, we created user portraits for each of our users. Part of the project was to combine our user portraits into a persona with our design team. Based on our persona we created a design vision, defining the needs of user and giver and defining the design challenge as a base for the Ideate Phase.</p>
               <h3>Receiver needs</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Fulfil his dream to travel the world / to go on adventures</li>
                  <li>Experience his multicultural roots</li>
                  <li>Reconnect to his grandparents to feel comfortable in starting his own family</li>
               </ul>  
               <h3>Giver needs</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Mend the relationship to the estranged part of the family</li>
                  <li>Cure the receiver’s homesickness</li>
                  <li>Support the receiver in his future plans to start a family</li>

               <h3>Ideate</h3>
               <p>In the idea phase we sketched a lot of ideas using a design matrix. Also, I conducted the “Crazy Eights Exercise” with a group of people from our course. The How Might We question I used for that was “How might we connect the receiver to past, present and future of family traditions and generations of his family?”. Individually, we came up with three draft concepts each, and after a discussion we combined them to three shared concepts of which we chose the best one based on feedback we got in class.</p>

               <h3>Prototype</h3>
               <p>In the prototype phase, we started with creating a paper prototype and tested it with users. Based on the feedback we received, we redid the paper prototype and created multiple versions of it, before testing again and translating our findings into digital prototypes. We also got a visit from Hallmark during the prototype phase, who gave us the feedback that we should simplify the card design and unwrapping part keeping in mind that there are users that do not want to spend a lot of time designing a card and opening a gift.</p>

               <h3>Test</h3>
               <p>With the paper and digital prototypes, I conducted around 10 user trials. I implemented the feedback I received in my iterated prototype versions. I also did final tests with my final digital prototype. Moreover, I tested different versions of the digital unwrapping, to find out which options our test users enjoyed most.</p>
               <h3>Feedback</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Confusing Instructions (e.g. "Oops" even though the answer was right)</li>
                  <li>The user needs a direct way to thank the giver, waiting time will result in no reply at all</li>
                  <li>Implementing voice recordings in the pull-outs will make the card too bulky</li>
                  <li>The user's interaction between card and unwrapping app should be consistent / we should decide on one type of interaction</li>
                </ul>  
               <h3>Main iterations</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>The receiver can reach out to the missing family member through social media; they do not have to meet up</li>
                  <li>Reformulating instructions in the unwrapping (more concise, more entertaining)</li>
                  <li>"Hallmark Loop": The receiver can directly send a Hallmark card back to the giver in order to thank him / her</li>
                  <li>Combining scanning of the pull-out pictures with the "Guess Who?! quiz in the app, creating interaction"</li>
                </ul>  
             </div>

         <div class="IntroLine">
             <h3>The result</h3>
             <p>After pitching our concept to our teachers, we were chosen to pitch to the client Hallmark. Since the project itself was about bespoke design, we turned our bespoke ideas into ideas and recommendations that Hallmark could actually use for their broad customer base.</p>
