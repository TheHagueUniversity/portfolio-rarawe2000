                 <h2>Fashion Video (Make it Fashion - Call it Art)</h2>
                 <p>This is a project I did in my free time, because I wanted to start working with video editing tools and combine music, fashion and videography in one project.</p>
                 <p>The idea behind the video is to encourage people to be creative and to be confident in going their own way. I made the video with minimalistic means, like old clothes I had left at home, and I recorded and edited it using my smartphone. I wanted to show that you do not have to be an expert with video editing tools, or you do not need a lot of equipment to be creative and to “make it fashion”. </p>
                 <p>Everyone can be creative; the point is to just get started and to have the courage to show that to the world. <i>“We ain’t born typical”</i> is a reference to being unique and to embracing individuality. Thinking outside the box and not following everyone else is what makes ideas stand out. </p>
